# Springboard Data Science Projects
This repository contains personal projects and work I've completed for the Springboard Data Science Program
<br/>
<br/>
#### Capstone 2 - Personalized Alert System
A start to end project which uses Deep Neural Networks classify images into a set of personalized sitautions. Deisgned to be integrated into a full monitoring/alert system.
<br/>
<br/>
#### Capstone 1 - NFL Matchup Predictions
A start to end project which leverages an NFL api to create a model for predicting the outcomes of NFL games based on matchup statistics
<br/>
<br/>
#### Data Wrangling
Small projects oriented to display skills for collecting and manipulating data. The folder includes practice manipulating JSON data, pulling data from a Database, and using a REST API.
<br/>
<br/>
#### EDA
Small projects which use statistical inference tests to determine significant differences and correlations while exploring datasets.
<br/>
<br/>
#### Machine Learning
Small projects related to various standard ML algorithms. Projects invlove preprocessing steps, hyperparameter tuning, and validations needed specific for the algorithm being used in the project. Clustering, Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Deep Neural Network algorithms are practiced in this section.
