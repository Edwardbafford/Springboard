For this project the data used was comprised of images parsed from videos as well as cleaned CSVs, images were resized, flattened, and classified manually into over 100 CSV files. This was about 4 GB of information and caused issues when pushing the data to Github, and because of this the data is stored locally. Within this directory is an example of the original images and one of the cleaned CSV file.
